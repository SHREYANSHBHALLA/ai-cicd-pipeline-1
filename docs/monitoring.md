# Monitoring Dashboard Setup and Usage

This document provides instructions on how to set up and use the monitoring dashboard included in the AI CI/CD Pipeline project. The monitoring dashboard is designed to track key metrics related to the performance and behavior of the AI agents.

## Setting Up the Monitoring Dashboard

1. **Configuration File**: The monitoring dashboard is configured using the `monitoring/dashboard_config.json` file. Ensure that this file is correctly set up with the desired metrics and parameters.

2. **Dependencies**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can find the required packages in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Running the Dashboard**: To start the monitoring dashboard, navigate to the directory where the dashboard application is located and run the following command:
   ```
   python -m monitoring.dashboard
   ```

## Metrics Tracked

The monitoring dashboard tracks the following key metrics:

- **Response Time**: Measures the time taken by the AI agent to respond to inputs.
- **Accuracy**: Evaluates the correctness of the responses generated by the AI agent.
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitors CPU and memory usage during the agent's operation.

## Interpreting the Dashboard

- **Graphs and Charts**: The dashboard displays various graphs and charts representing the tracked metrics over time. Pay attention to any spikes or anomalies that may indicate performance issues.
- **Alerts**: Set up alerts for critical metrics to notify you when performance thresholds are exceeded.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or using the monitoring dashboard, consider the following steps:

- Check the configuration in `dashboard_config.json` for any errors.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
- Review the logs for any error messages that may provide insight into the problem.
