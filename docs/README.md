# AI CI/CD Pipeline Project Documentation

## Overview

The AI CI/CD Pipeline Project is designed to facilitate the development, testing, and deployment of AI agents. This project implements a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that automates quality checks, provides a monitoring dashboard, and includes comprehensive documentation to assist developers and users.

## Key Components

- **AI Agents**: The core functionality of the project is encapsulated in the AI agents located in the `src/agents` directory. These agents are responsible for processing input and generating responses based on predefined logic.

- **Testing**: Unit tests for the AI agents are located in the `src/tests` directory. The project utilizes `pytest` to ensure the accuracy, latency, and security compliance of the agents.

- **CI/CD Configuration**: The project supports CI/CD through both GitHub Actions and Jenkins. The configuration files for these systems are located in the `.github/workflows` and `jenkins` directories, respectively.

- **Monitoring**: A monitoring dashboard is included to track key metrics related to the AI agents. Configuration details for the dashboard can be found in the `monitoring` directory.

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is provided in the `docs` directory, covering setup instructions, monitoring setup, and contribution guidelines.
