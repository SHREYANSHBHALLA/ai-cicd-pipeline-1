## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the setup instructions in the `docs/setup.md` file. This will guide you through the environment setup, dependencies installation, and how to run the AI agent locally.

## Testing

Unit tests for the AI agent are located in the `src/tests/test_example_agent.py` file. The project uses `pytest` for testing, ensuring the agent's response accuracy, latency, and security compliance.

## CI/CD Configuration

The CI/CD pipeline is configured using both GitHub Actions and Jenkins:

- **GitHub Actions**: The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`, automating the testing and deployment process.
- **Jenkins**: The pipeline stages are defined in `jenkins/Jenkinsfile`, providing an alternative CI/CD setup.

## Monitoring

A monitoring dashboard is included in the project to track key metrics. Configuration details can be found in `monitoring/dashboard_config.json`, and usage instructions are available in `docs/monitoring.md`.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is provided in the `docs` directory, covering the project overview, setup instructions, and monitoring setup.
