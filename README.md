## Testing

- Unit tests are located in `src/tests/test_example_agent.py`.
- The project uses `pytest` for:
  - **Response accuracy**
  - **Latency**
  - **Security compliance**

---

## CI/CD Configuration

- **GitHub Actions:**  
  Workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` automates testing and deployment on every push or pull request to `main`.

- **Jenkins:**  
  Alternative pipeline stages are defined in `jenkins/Jenkinsfile`.

---

## Monitoring

- **Dashboard:**  
  A Dash-based web dashboard displays key metrics for deployed agents.
- **Configuration:**  
  Metrics and thresholds are defined in `monitoring/dashboard_config.json`.
- **Live Data:**  
  The dashboard reads real-time metrics from `monitoring/metrics.json` (ensure your agent writes to this file).
- **Usage:**  
  See `docs/monitoring.md` for details.

---

## Documentation

- **Technical Overview, Setup, and Monitoring:**  
  See the `docs` directory for:
  - `README.md` (overview)
  - `setup.md` (installation and usage)
  - `monitoring.md` (dashboard and metrics)
